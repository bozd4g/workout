This is a simple workout repository that I use to track my workout progress.

### [3x5 Workout Program](3x5.md)

This is a 3x5 and 3x8-12 (assistant) workout program. It is a simple program that is easy to follow and is a good starting point for beginners. It is also a good program for intermediate lifters who want to focus on strength and size.

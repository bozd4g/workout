# Workout

This is a simple workout repository that I use to track my workout progress.

### [3x5 Workout Program](3x5.md)

This is a 3x5 and 3x8-12 (assistant) workout program. It is a simple program that is easy to follow and is a good starting point for beginners. It is also a good program for intermediate lifters who want to focus on strength and size.

### Current Program (3x5)

This is the my current program. I will use this program for 3-4 months. After 3-4 months, I will switch to another program.

Also you can change assistant exercises after 4 weeks.
